Behavior Tree the asset is the data, so the rules you create that controls how AI characters behave. It’s like an AI program.
Behavior Tree Component is the actual running component that you attach to an AI character, which then points to a Behavior Tree asset that controls a character. It’s your AI’s CPU that actually executes the program (above).
Blackboard is the same, but it’s a data store that the Behavior Tree uses to remember what other actors and locations the actor is behaving using/towards. It’s your AI’s memory so it knows where to go, who to shoot, etc.
